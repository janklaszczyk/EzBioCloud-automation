I. Some general sctructure of the repo(better to talk in person)
	1. correct file extention and name. Python scripts should have .py extention
	2. use:
		if __name__='__main__':
			...
	3. Divide the code thematicly into separate files.
		e.g.
		- main.py - file that should be run
		- file_handler.py
		- some_data_manipulator.py? - not sure what you do there yet
	4. Good to have .gitignore - to exclude 

II. If you have some constants:
		filepaths
		urls
		magic numbers
		it is bests to save them in some config
			pydantic_settings has some neet validation
			but simple dataclass can be nice
			
			Or you can use config parser but it is more hussle then it is worth
			
		At least save them as constants at top of the file

III. Use some environment manager
	venv is the simplest
	poetry is extending venv for git repositories
	
IV. you can write some unittests

V. If you don't use, start using ruff, and black.
	pip install ruff
	pip install black
